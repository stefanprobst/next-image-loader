# next-image-loader

This is the webpack image loader extracted from Next.js, so it can be used in Storybook. Also
exposes a helper function to generate `width`, `height` and `blurDataURL`, which can be used e.g. in
a `remark`/`rehype` plugin to generate static images from image file paths in frontmatter metadata.
